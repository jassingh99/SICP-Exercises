(define x (list 1 2 3))
(define y (list 4 5 6))

; append is defined to, well, append, so the result of (append x y) should be (1 2 3 4 5 6)
(append x y)

; recall that list is defined to be closed under cons on the left
; i.e. (cons a (list b c d ...)) = (list a b c d ...)
; so (cons x y) = (list x 4 5 6) = ((1 2 3) 4 5 6)
(cons x y)

; finally, (list x y) = (x y) = ((1 2 3) (4 5 6))
(list x y)
