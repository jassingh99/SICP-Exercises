this seems like a decent heuristic but it is certainly not a general fact
imagine we had some function f which is algebraically just the identity, but in practical computation is wildly inefficient and introduces a lot of approximation errors
for instance, f could be the composition of a (poor) square root and square procedure
consider then the calculation x |-> x + x
on intervals, this could be computed as I + I or as 2 * f(I)
I is repeated in the former but not the latter
however, we expect the latter to have a much worse tolerance
of course, eva could argue that the f procedure would use I multiple times internally, but I think this reflects the fact that this heuristic is not a general fact
it relies on the form the procedure is presented in, and this need not be sensible
but again, this example is contrived and the heuristic seems ok

in the case of par1 and par2, the testing in 2.14 suggests that par1 and par2 compute the same center (up to a small degree of error) and that par2 has a lower tolerance than par1
