we trace the value of (car (cons xy)) via substitution as follows:
    (car (cons x y))
    (car (lambda (m)
                 (m x y)
         )
    )
    (
        (lambda (m)
                (m x y)
        )
        (lambda (p q)
                p
        )
    )
this, in turn, is evaluated using the usual beta-reduction rule of lambda calculus
that is, the (lambda (p q) q) block is substituted for m in the body of (lambda (m) (m x y))
    (
        (lambda (p q)
                p
        )
        x
        y
    )
again, applying the lambda calculus beta-reduction, we substitute (p:=x) and (q:= y) in the body
so finally, the value is
    x
thus, we have shown (car (cons x y)) reducing to x
this same line of reasoning shows that cdr can be defined as
    (define (cdr z)
            (z 
                (lambda (p q)
                        q
                )
            )
    )
