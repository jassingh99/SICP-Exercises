so all in all, this yields 4 ways to change 11 cents
parsing through this tree, we can list these as
DP
NPPPPPP
NNP
PPPPPPPPPPP

formally the process works like this
fix some list l of n coins with varying values, e.g. 50,25,10,5,1
(cc a n) satisfies the recurrence (cc a l) = (cc a l[1:]) + (cc (a - l[0]) l)
here we are using the python list syntx l[1:] = [l[1], l[2], ..., l[n - 1]]
the time complexity T and memory complexity M depend only on the size of l, so long as we treat basic arithmetic and shit as constant
then T satisfies T(a, n) <= T(a, n - 1) + T(a - 1, n)
here we use a - 1 for simplicity, as the slowest way for the a coordinate to decrease is to be one at a time. really, it goes like a, a - l[0], a - l[0] - l[1], etc
so roughly, T(a, n) grows like C(a + n, a) = (a+n)! / (a! n!)
we usually take n = 5 so this is roughly (a + 5)! / (5! a!) = (a+5)(a+5)(a+3)(a+2)(a+1) = Î¸(a^5)
as for memory, the largest branch of this tree will be when the program figures out the all penny approach: (cc n 1) = (cc (- n d) 1) + (cc n 0) ... so this terminates with 1 after around n/d steps, where d = l[n - 1], so 1 in this special case.
at any point in this computation, the interpreter need only keep track of the whole path back to the root. the longest such path is Î¸(n)
