; I'll do the sum I had in 29 as opposed to their sum
; I explained the difference in the comments on 29

(define (sum term a b next) 
        ; in this iterative process, the value (sum term i b next) + (result) is invariant
        ; we begin at (sum term a b next) + 0
        ; at the end, this becomes (sum term (next b) b next) + result
        ; and the former summand is 0 by convention.
        (define (iter i result)
                (if (> i b)
                    result
                    (iter (next i)
                          (+ (term i)
                             result
                          )
                    )
                )
        )

        (iter a 0)
)

; below are some basic definitions and tests

(define (inc n)
        (+ n 1)
)

(define (id a)
        a
)

(sum id 1 5 inc)
(sum id -1 5 inc)
(sum id 5 5 inc)
(sum id 5 0 inc)

(define (cube x)
        (* x x x)
)

(sum cube 1 10 inc)
