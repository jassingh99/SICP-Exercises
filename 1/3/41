; the procedure (double double) takes f and returns f^4 (multiplication is composition)
; so double (double double) takes f and returns f^8
; so ((double (double double)) inc) is inc^8: x \mapsto x + 8
; so we expect this to be 13

; I got my parentheses wrong above^^^
; I computed (double ((double double) inc)), which does send x \mapsto x + 8

; (double (double double)) takes f \mapsto (

;                                          )
; which is (

;          )                                      

; and finally, (double (double (double (double f))))
; which is f^16
; and inc^16: x \mapsto 16, so we expect the result to be 21
